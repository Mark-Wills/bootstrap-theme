# bootstrap-theme
A very nice bootstrap theme to start you off. Includes a navbar. The navbar menu items collapse nicely on mobile devices, and the navbar is scrollable, particularly important on mobile devices in landscape mode.

To see this theme in action, see the [YouTube video](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=09BToC_yTzg)
